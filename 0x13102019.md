# The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

It is already early October and there's no testnet. Here's why this is a good thing.

## Istanbul was Constantinople now it's Istanbul not Constantinople

One of the main things that made us reconsider our originally proposed timeline was the planned Istanbul hardfork on Ethereum. The Kovan testnet [has done the hardfork without issues](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x2af6793955c44947bde2f959f5fb4b7f4099144e) just today. What does this mean for smartcontracts? Essentially all SLOAD operations now cost 800 instead of 200 gas, but we also get faster block times (4 seconds).

This also means that our initial gas cost estimates went straight into the trash as we originally relied on quite a lot of SLOAD and SSTORE which are now too expensive in the way we initially planned it. That's okay though, as we also came across something fun.

## Layer 2 hacks on Ethereum? Now? Oh boy!

The Plasma group released a pretty cool project called Unipig. It is a spoof of the already running and well working Uniswap exchange, but with a twist; you don't pay any gas. At all. This made us wonder how to steal the power of those wizards and abuse it for our own magick tricks.

And this is where we are right now: pooling more hours into extensive research on Layer 2 solutions to remove gas cost from 0xchan's main functions. If we succeed, you can enjoy shitposting at a rate of 1 ZCH per post and not worry about gas. That means you can pre-purchase ZCH and lock them away for bad times and continue shitposting even if you ran out of Ethereum to pay gas.

We know this is not what you were looking forward to and we're sorry about this, but look at it this way: if we can grab that tech, it's all gonna be fine.

## What about the ugly tho?

Starting right now, the [0xchan Frontend Repository](https://github.com/n4n0GH/0xchan-frontend) is open for viewing, forking, issue-making, stalking. I'm still working on the codebase and you're free to clone the repository as it is right now and play with the codebase to your heart's content, find bugs, come up with cool ideas.
